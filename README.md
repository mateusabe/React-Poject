This repository contains a personal learning project built with React.js. It was created to explore and practice core React concepts such as:

Component-based architecture

State and props management

Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)

Event handling

Conditional rendering

Forms and controlled components

Component styling (CSS Modules / Styled Components / Tailwind)

React Router (if applicable)

API integration with fetch or Axios (if used)

The goal of this project is to reinforce foundational React skills and serve as a sandbox for experimentation and practice. It's not intended for production use but rather as a reference for future projects and continued growth in frontend development.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute!
